# Lissom.CSS
**The web is bloated.** Trackers, advertisements, third-party JavaScript, custom fonts, unoptimized images, and useless CSS are prevalent on too many websites, all detrimental to user experience.

**Lissom.CSS is a classless, minimalist, accessible, and themeable CSS library that aims to address the issue of styling web pages.**
